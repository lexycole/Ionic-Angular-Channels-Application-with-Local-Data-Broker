# ‚úçÔ∏è About 
The Ionic Angular Channels Application is a mobile application that allows users to manage channels and channel items. It utilizes the browser's localStorage to store and retrieve channel data, simulating a local data broker service. The application provides a user-friendly interface with customizable UI elements, including pagination, swipe refresh, spinners, toasts, and buttons.
Users can create, read, update, and delete channels and channel items through the application's CRUD functionality. If no channel data is found in the localStorage, the application generates fake channel data using the Faker.js library for demonstration purposes.
The application is built using Ionic Angular, a framework for developing hybrid mobile applications with Angular and Apache Cordova. It offers a configurable data broker service with options for pagination settings, UI customizations, and page behavior. Additionally, the application includes methods for handling various events related to channels and channel items, as well as permissions management for CRUD operations.
Overall, the Ionic Angular Channels Application provides a comprehensive solution for managing channels and channel items in a mobile environment, with features such as local data storage, fake data generation, CRUD operations, pagination, and customizable UI elements.
